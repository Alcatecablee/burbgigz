Call Now!"), often with fake scans or logos from Microsoft/Apple. It urges calling a number for "immediate help," where scammers demand payment or remote access via tools like AnyDesk.

 In 2025, these increasingly use browser extensions or poisoned search ads to inject fake support numbers into legitimate sites.

Phishing Emails/Texts Leading to Popups: Unsolicited messages link to fake sites that trigger popups or download malware mimicking support alerts. Victims are directed to call or install "fix" software, enabling data theft.
Browser Hijacks and Notification Scams: Malicious sites or extensions lock browsers, spam notifications, or insert fake tech support ads into search results/Google, urging calls for "fixes."
Recovery Scams: Post-scam fraud where "helpers" charge for fake recovery services, exploiting victims of initial tech support cons.

These scams cost millions annually, targeting all ages but hitting older users hardest, with popups evolving via AI for urgency. Always verify via official channels—real companies don't cold-call or demand immediate remote access.How to Make People Trust Your Legitimate IT Support SiteIn a scam-saturated space, trust is built through transparency, security, and social proof—differentiating your site from fakes that use urgency, fake logos, or unsolicited access requests. Focus on these strategies:Secure Your Site Technically: Use HTTPS (lock icon in address bar) and display it prominently—no scammy site skips this. Add SSL certificates, run malware scans (e.g., via Google Safe Browsing), and avoid suspicious redirects/popups. Tools like ScamAdviser can verify your domain's legitimacy.
Show Clear Credentials and Transparency: Feature certifications (e.g., CompTIA A+), business registration (CIPC in SA), and a physical address/phone in Lombardy East. Include an "About" page with your bio, no unsolicited access requests, and upfront pricing (e.g., R120 remote, R400 on-site). Explain tools like RustDesk explicitly: "Secure, consent-based access—end anytime."
Leverage Social Proof: Display Google reviews, testimonials, and case studies (e.g., "Fixed Wi-Fi in Edenvale remotely"). Encourage verified feedback on Google My Business. Avoid fake urgency—use educational content like blog posts on scams to position yourself as an expert.
Educate on Scams: Add a dedicated "Avoid Scams" page/blog warning about popups/calls, linking to FTC/Microsoft guides. This builds authority: "We never cold-call or demand remote access without consent."
Strong Privacy and Support Policies: Publish a clear privacy policy (POPIA-compliant in SA), no data selling, and easy contact (WhatsApp/email, not just popups). Offer free advice/resources to demonstrate value without pressure.
SEO and Local Presence: Optimize for "IT support Lombardy East" with Google My Business listing, encouraging reviews. Use trust seals (e.g., BBB if applicable) and avoid suspicious ads.
User Education and Verification: On remote pages, include FAQs like "Is this safe? Yes—unlike scams, we require consent and use encrypted tools." Verify users via simple checks (e.g., email confirmation).
